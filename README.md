# Task
Making Sqlite using Ruby.

Both SqLiteRequest and MySqliteCLI have lots of pre-written examples to use at the bottom of the file.
# Description
The CLI uses space as its row_sep and single quotations as its quote character.
So please format queries in the CLI with this in mind.
Remember that INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE changes the CSV file, aka representation of the database.
Followed SQL behavior as closely as possible. E.g, DELETE/UPDATE with no where operates on all rows, etc
